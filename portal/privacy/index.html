					<p>It is MaximumFX's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our website.
						This Privacy Policy applies to <a href="https://maximumfx.nl/">https://maximumfx.nl/</a> (hereinafter, "<b>us</b>", "<b>we</b>", or "<b>https://maximumfx.nl/</b>").
						We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting personally identifiable information you may provide us through the Website.
						We have adopted this privacy policy ("<b>Privacy Policy</b>") to explain what information may be collected on our Website, how we use this information, and under what circumstances we may disclose the information to third parties.
						This Privacy Policy applies only to information we collect through the Website and does not apply to our collection of information from other sources.</p>
					<p>If you have additional questions or require more information about our Privacy Policy, do not hesitate to <a href="mailto:privacy@maximumfx.nl">contact us.</a></p>
					<p>This Privacy Policy applies only to our online activities and is valid for visitors to our website with regards to the information that they shared and/or collect in MaximumFX.
						This policy is not applicable to any information collected offline or via channels other than this website.</p>

					<h3>Consent</h3>
					<p>By using our website, you hereby consent to our Privacy Policy and agree to its terms.</p>

					<h3>Website Visitors</h3>
					<p>Like most website operators, MaximumFX collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. MaximumFX's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how MaximumFX's visitors use its website. From time to time, MaximumFX may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>
					<p>MaximumFX also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on https://maximumfx.nl/ blog posts.
						MaximumFX only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below.</p>

					<h3>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
					<p>Certain visitors to MaximumFX's websites choose to interact with MaximumFX in ways that require MaximumFX to gather personally-identifying information.
						The amount and type of information that MaximumFX gathers depends on the nature of the interaction.</p>

					<h3>Security</h3>
					<p>The security of your Personal Information is important to us, but remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure.
						While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>

					<h3>Advertisements</h3>
					<p>Ads appearing on our website may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who may set cookies.
						These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer.
						This information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you.
						This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by MaximumFX and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.</p>

					<h3>Links To External Sites</h3>
					<p>Our Service may contain links to external sites that are not operated by us. If you click on a third party link, you will be directed to that third party's site. We strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy and terms and conditions of every site you visit.</p>
					<p>We have no control over, and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies or practices of any third party sites, products or services.</p>

					<h3>Aggregated Statistics</h3>
					<p>MaximumFX may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its website. MaximumFX may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, MaximumFX does not disclose your personally-identifying information.</p>

					<h3 id="cookies">Cookies</h3>
					<p>To enrich and perfect your online experience, MaximumFX uses "Cookies", similar technologies and services provided by others to display personalized content, appropriate advertising and store your preferences on your computer.</p>
					<p>A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor's computer, and that the visitor's browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns.
						MaximumFX uses cookies to help MaximumFX identify and track visitors, their usage of https://maximumfx.nl/, and their website access preferences.
						MaximumFX visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using MaximumFX's websites, with the drawback that certain features of MaximumFX's websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.</p>
					<p>By continuing to navigate our website without changing your cookie settings, you hereby acknowledge and agree to MaximumFX's use of cookies.</p>

					<h3>Children's Information</h3>
					<p>Another part of our priority is adding protection for children while using the internet.
						We encourage parents and guardians to observe, participate in, and/or monitor and guide their online activity.</p>
					<p>MaximumFX does not knowingly collect any Personal Identifiable Information from children under the age of 13.
						If you think that your child provided this kind of information on our website, we strongly encourage you to contact us immediately and we will do our best efforts to promptly remove such information from our records.</p>

					<h3>Privacy Policy Changes</h3>
					<p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, MaximumFX may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in MaximumFX's sole discretion. MaximumFX encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy.
